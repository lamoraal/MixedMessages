//Array 2 : songtitles, get at least forty

//Array 3 : booktitles, get at least twenty

//function to get a random number
//parameter will be a number (the length of one of the three arrays)
//return will be a random number




//function to get a random entry from an array
//parameter will be an array
//this function will use the function above
//return will be a random entry



//function to make up the full message
//this will go through three steps, adding to the message that will be outputted to the user
//Put the three messages all in this one function, or make three extra smaller functions.
